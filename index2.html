<h4>For global nonprofits, content is king</h4><br>

<p>Let's face it. Amazon would kill to have the content you have.</p>
<p>In the run up to the release of its Echo Dot smart speaker, Amazon made more than 100 ten-second videos promoting the device. The spots were aimed at putting a human face on the technology and showing the utility of having a personal digital assistant at the ready for all of life's humorous, and sometimes touching, challenges.</p>
<p>Think of them like <a href="https://youtu.be/KLjdoF7Es6s" target=_blank><i>Vine</i> videos</a> as commercials.</p>
<p>Except for sheer number of the videos they created, there's nothing all that revolutionary about Amazon's approach. There's nothing new about using emotion in ads. Or even drawing on real life as the source of that emotion. There's even a hint of <i>realness</i> in the spots, but only a hint. Perhaps the marketers at Amazon would have preferred to use real emotion, real life in the spots, or perhaps not. But the question is, how would the spots change if they were real, both in terms of their content and their effectiveness? And what would those changes say about Amazon's presence in our lives?</p>
<p>What are the possibilities when the stories we draw on to make others take action <i>are</i> real?</p>
<blockquote>My crown is in my heart, not on my head; not decked with diamonds and Indian stones, nor to be seen: my crown is called content, a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy. &mdash; William Shakespeare, <i>Henry VI, Part 3, act III, scene 1</i></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps you'll pardon the poetic license here. Shakespeare's Henry VI is talking not about stories, but about an emotion. He's talking about, we presume, contentment. But I think his words still resonate when viewed in an alternate meaning of the word. About <i>words and pictures</i>.</p>
<p>Real people generate stories. And interactions between people generate more stories. As organizations who deal not in material goods, but in human-to-human interactions, nonprofits are are wealthy with stories.</p>

<h2 class=header-heading>Enabling Content</h2><br>
    <h4>How global NGOs thrive by delivering dial tone</h4><br>
  <h4>by Joe Sundermeyer</h4>

<div class=main>
  <p><img class=img-responsive src="telephone_pole.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p> As a national telephone network evolved in the U.S. during the early part of the last century, some smart people at places like AT&amp;T realized that they were facing a problem.</p>
<p> The telephone (arguably the last great technological advancement in communication before the arrival of the internet) relied on human operators to connect calls. As the system grew, phone companies worried whether they would be able to hire and train operators fast enough to keep pace.</p>
<p>Systems to automatically place calls had existed since the earliest days of the technology, but they were finicky. Users had to wait for their phone to establish a connection before dialing or things got tangled in a hurry. So engineers devised a solution.</p>
  <h4><strong>Enter the dial tone</strong></h4>
<p>Bell system engineers created a sound that let users know that the phone was ready to place a call. Like the distinctive cacophony of a modem 50 years later, the dial tone signalled to a caller that the network was standing by to receive instructions and deliver the goods.</p>
<p>More than just a signal that the system was working, the dial tone was, in some ways, a conduit in and of itself. As linemen delivered phone systems to communities across the country, that sound &mdash; the fourth E above middle C &mdash; was a frictionless entry point and an enabler of communication.</p>
  <h4><strong>An open line</strong></h4>
<p>Like every organization that relies on stories, which increasingly is <em>every</em> organization, NGOs that rely on content to tell stories about families who live in poverty face a similar challenge to the Bell engineers of the 1940s. There are more stories than there are intermediaries to help tell them. Moreover, intermediaries create friction in the system and dilute authenticity, which are the enemies of good content.</p>
<p>Web publisher Tim O'Reilly has said that technology, and the content that accompanies it, naturally moves from an operator-assisted mode toward a state of "dial tone." Building a web site just 10 years ago required significant technical knowledge. The advent of blogs and social networks has all but eliminated these barriers. Facebook is the dial tone for creating a web presence.</p>
<p>And multimedia-based applications like Snapchat, Vine and Periscope have lowered the bar even further, putting sophisticated broadcasting tools in the hands of any person with a smartphone.</p>
<p>For staff at NGOs whose job it is to tell stories that both raise awareness of, and offer solutions to, particular societal problems, the presence of people in the network armed with this technology represents an open line to the humanity of the situation.</p>
  <p><img class=img-responsive src="poles.png" alt=""></p>
<h4><strong>Crowdsourcing content</strong></h4>
<p>Delivering dial tone for NGOs means allowing conduits for content that already exist to work in service of the goals of the organization. With a bit of training, cohorts of content creators around the world can give donors and potential donors insight into the problems they help overcome.</p>
<p>This is just as important in Atlanta, for the people who donate money to the cause, as it is in Zamboanga, for the people who derive benefit from the work. Donors can use the tools of digital communication to talk about the lessons they derive from getting involved, while people in the field put a face and a name and a <em>story</em> to problems that are otherwise just abstractions.</p>
<p>Best of all, in this scenario, stories told on behalf of the organization are unfiltered and authentic, which are the touchstones of any successful narrative.</p>
<p>Crowdsourced content is the opposite of faceless, bland content that often gets generated by institutions and it meets some of the most critical requirements of successful digital communications.</p>
    <p><img class=img-responsive src="poles_2.jpg" width="500px" alt=""></p>
<h4><strong>Transparency, Personality, Participation</strong></h4>
<p>There are three essential ways in which dial tone-derived content helps improve engagement.</p>
  <blockquote>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong>. Direct, unfiltered content created by donors and beneficiaries and distributed by the organization shows a commitment to transparent dialogue about issues, successes and, perhaps more importantly, about the challenges the organization faces.</p>
<p><strong>Personality</strong>. An NGO's personality is revealed most strikingly in the voices and faces of the people who are part of it, both as supporters and beneficiaries.</p>
<p><strong>Participation</strong>. It is not enough to enable conversation. The best organizations add their own voices to the mix, engaging with supporters, staff and the people around the world whom they both, ultimately, serve. And they do all of it in the open.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h4><strong>What about the operators?</strong></h4>
<p>There are a lot fewer telephone operators around today than there were in 1950, or even 1980. We just don't need them. So as we push the dial tone closer and closer to the end user, is it true that we need fewer and fewer intermediaries?</p>
<p>Not when it comes to content.</p>
<p>Crowdsourced content is only one part of an organization's portfolio. Professional storytellers provide an invaluable service. Unlike those early telephone operators who simply connected the user with the network, professional communicators moderate conversations, add context and move the overall narrative forward.</p>
