          <p class="popup">Conversations fuel commerce. Brands are narratives. Media is social. Words travel fast.</p>
          <p class="popup">Storytelling is one of our most powerful tools as human beings. We talk about ourselves in snippets and status updates via Facebook and Twitter. We share our photos on Instagram. Over time, our stories are told.</p>
          <p class="popup">I am a communicator. I am a storyteller. I meet business opportunities with the tools of successful communication: the simple beauty of words and pictures combined in meaningful patterns.</p>
          <p class="popup">If the marketplace is a conversation, then the strength of your presence in the hearts and minds of consumers is determined by the strength of your voice. Writers are your voice.</p>
          <p class="popup">I’ve written a lot of words. Online. Offline. On paper and as a collection of electrons on a screen. But the lessons of good writing are simple.</p>
          <p class="popup">Watch for the details. Listen when people talk and watch what they do. Find your voice. And use it.</p>
