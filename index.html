  <h4>How global NGOs thrive by delivering dial tone</h4>

  <p> As the telephone network evolved during the early part of the last century, smart people at places like AT&amp;T realized that they were facing a problem.</p>
<p> The telephone (arguably the last great technological advancement in communication before the arrival of the internet) relied on human operators to connect calls. As the system grew, phone companies worried whether they would be able to hire and train operators fast enough to keep pace.</p>
<p>Sytems to automatically place phone calls had existed since the earliest days of the telephone, but they were finicky. Users had to wait for their phone to establish a connection to the network before dialing or things got tangled in a hurry. So engineers devised a solution.</p>
<p>Enter the dial tone.</p>
<p>Bell system engineers created a sound that let users know that the phone was ready to place a call. Like the distinctive caucophony of a modem 50 years later, the dial tone signalled to a caller that the network was ready to receive information and deliver the goods.</p>
<p>More than just a signal that the system was working, the dial tone, was, in some ways, a conduit in an of itself. As linemen delivered phone systems to communities across the country, that sound &mdash; the fourth E above middle C &mdash; was a frictionless entry point and an enabler of communication.</p>
  <blockquote>
    “The dial tone is the equipment’s way of telling you that it’s ready to put through your call,” explained an instructional film called “Dial Comes to Town.” “It’s the same as an operator saying, ‘Number, please?’ ”
  </blockquote>
<p>Like every organization that relies on stories, which increasingly is <em>every</em> organization, NGOs that rely on content to tell stories about families who live in poverty face a similar challenge to the Bell engineers of the 1940s. There are more stories than there are intermediaries to help tell them. Moreover, intermediaries create friction in the system and dilute authenticity, which are the enemies of good content.</p>
