<h4>For nonprofits, content is king</h4><br>

<p>Let's face it. Amazon would kill to have the content you have.</p>
<p>In the run-up to the release of its Echo Dot smart speaker, Amazon made more than <a href="https://www.ispot.tv/brands/ZnS/amazon-echo" target="_blank">100 ten-second videos</a> promoting the device. The spots were aimed at putting a human face on technology and showing the utility of having a personal digital assistant at the ready for all of life's humorous, and sometimes touching, challenges.</p>
<p>It's as if someone chose to use <a href="https://youtu.be/KLjdoF7Es6s" target=_blank><i>Vine</i> videos</a> as commercials.</p>
<p>Except for the sheer number of spots they created, there is nothing all that revolutionary about Amazon's approach. There is nothing new, after all, about using humor in ads. Or even drawing on real life as the source of that humor. There is a hint of <i>realness</i> to the spots, but only a hint, courtesy of the fact that Amazon claims the vignettes were inspired by the experiences of real users. Perhaps the marketers at Amazon would have preferred to use <i>actual</i> Echo users in the videos and their <i>actual</i> experiences, or perhaps not. The authenticity of the videos is sort of beside the point. The question is about the value of manufactured authenticity and how the content would change if the stories were real. Would it make them more effective and engaging? And what would those changes say about Amazon's presence in our lives?</p>
<p>In other words, what are the possibilities when the stories we draw on to make others take action <i>are</i> real?</p>

<blockquote>My crown is in my heart, not on my head; not decked with diamonds and Indian stones, nor to be seen: my crown is called content, a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy. &mdash; William Shakespeare, <i>Henry VI, Part 3, act III, scene 1</i></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps you'll pardon the poetic license here. Shakespeare's Henry VI is not talking about stories, but about emotions. He's talking about, we presume, contentment, happiness. But this analogy to a &ldquo;crown of content&rdquo; still works if it's considered with an alternate meaning &mdash; the words and pictures (both moving and not) that make up communication.</p>
<p>Real people generate content. And contact between people generates more content. As organizations who trade not in material goods, but in human-to-human interactions, nonprofits are wealthy with content.</p>
    <h4><strong>The information economy (briefly)</strong></h4>
  <p>We are in the middle of a golden age for storytelling (more on this in a future post). Words, pictures and video have become like fossil fuels were in the Fifties. There seems to be no end to our capacity to produce them, and our appetite for them is limitless. At the same time, the gap between content producers and consumers has narrowed (smart people who think and write about such things call this <i>disintermediation</i>). Moreover, and increasingly, producers and consumers <i>are the same people</i>. So we've got a bunch of people producing a bunch of content for a bunch of other people (or for themselves) that is ready to be consumed &agrave; la carte at any hour of the day. Or any minute.</p>
  <h5><strong>Content created each minute online</strong></h5>
  <ul>
    <li>400 hours of video on YouTube</li>
    <li>216,000 photos on Facebook</li>
    <li>10,000 tweets</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As content grows exponentially, the only limiting factor in the growth of the information economy becomes people's ability to pay attention to it. For those of us seeking to attract some portion of this limited attention, the challenge becomes distinguishing our messages from the clamor of the internet at large.</p>
  <p>Companies like Amazon may choose to do this by manufacturing stories that mimic the unpolished authenticity of the larger content ecosystem. Organizations who are more relationship-focused by their very existence, therefore, have a distinct advantage in their ability to attract attention based on the inherent humanity of the stories they tell.</p> 
    <p><img class=img-responsive src="sea_king.jpg" alt=""></p>
  <h4><strong>Real life, real stories</strong></h4>
<p>Even when dealing with technology that itself speaks, like the Echo, the conversation that Amazon can have about its products is pretty one-sided. Amazon's voice is of a faceless, monolithic entity that speaks in the language of advertising and marketing. Product reviews, which are the best representations of people talking to, or about, institutions are, at best, like shoppers standing in a crowded bazaar shouting at one another. Companies rarely speak, though they are often spoken to. In fact, a case could be made that companies like Amazon are inherently unable to speak as individuals. Theirs are the voices of the institution and their stories the stories of commerce. Corporations are, in fact, not people.</p>
<p>Nonprofits who serve people, and attempt to attract other people and their resources to a cause, have the benefit of being able to draw upon the stories told by everyone involved. Theirs are stories filled with human emotion, drama, pathos, ingenuity, success and failure; raising issues of power and struggle and what it means to be human. They are the antithesis of advertising and marketing, though they have utility as tools for raising awareness and building support.</p>
  <p>Whether mediated or unmediated, <a href="https://joesundermeyer.github.io/crowdsourcing.html">crowdsourced</a> or not &mdash; whether it's words, pictures, audio or video (ideally it's all of those), authentic content is the single greatest advantage nonprofits have over their for-profit peers.</p>
  <p>The questions I asked earlier about how Amazon's Echo videos might have been different if they were more authentic, and what that authenticity could have to say about Amazon's place in the lives of consumers, are answered every day by content creators. Stories that are authentically human are TED Talks. They are moms in Chewbacca masks and kids in Batman costumes.</p>
  <p>They are stories from families who lift themselves up in the face of adversity and the people who extend a hand to help. Sometimes they are more immediate: they are unfiltered, unretouched, un-manufactured, free-range moments that ask to be shared. And sometimes they are longer, more complex narratives that require the deft hand of a storyteller to unpack and show to the world. In any case, they are important for the glimpse they offer into the lives of the people who are most easily forgotten.</p>
  <p>As nonprofits who work in relationships between people, we are called to use all the tools at our disposal to pique interest, to capture attention and to galvanize support for those most in need of it. And we need to be as astute about it as Amazon is about selling smart speakers and laundry detergent.</p>
  <p>We are indeed "crowned with content" and it is a crown that even kings like Jeff Bezos seldom enjoy.</p>
